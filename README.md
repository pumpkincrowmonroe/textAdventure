# textadventure

A (partial) text-based choose your adventure set in a modern-day high school and written entirely in Python.

Set up to allow for class choice, stats allocated reflective of class, and branching paths.

This is a partial text adventure, meaning it is only, roughly, half finished. What exists, however, is the core of the adventure. What is unfinished, largely, is just the story and the text. The classes and the structure are set up from the beginning.
